 * Schema stamps for the versioned API and the deployment preflight check (#803).

 * Both stamps are derived from Prisma migration names: the 14-digit prefix of a
 * migration directory (e.g. `20260725000002_add_wallet_auth` -> `20260725000002`).
 * Because they share one coordinate system, the database stamp and the stamp the
 * indexer reports can be compared directly.
 *
 * - `DATABASE` – migration stamp this build expects the database to be at.
 * - `INDEXER`  – stamp the indexer writes into its checkpoint on startup.
 * - `OLDEST`   – oldest migration stamp this build can still serve. Anything
 *   older predates a schema the current code depends on and must be migrated first.
 * - `SUPPORTED_*` – the migration stamps inside the supported window, published
 *   through `GET /schema-version` so integrators can see what is servable.
 *   Compatibility itself is a range check (see `getVersionMismatch`), so a stamp
 *   inside the window that is not enumerated here is still compatible.
 *
 * Versioning rules:
 * - Adding a migration that changes the shape of read/write paths bumps
 *   `DATABASE` and `INDEXER` together and appends the stamp to `SUPPORTED_*`.
 * - Extending the window backwards (raising `OLDEST`) is a breaking change for
 *   anyone pinned to an older deployment and must be announced in
 *   `backend/docs/SCHEMA_VERSIONS.md`.
